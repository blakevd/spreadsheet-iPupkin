Instructions:
	How do I use the spreadsheet?
		First, click on the desired cell and then the box labeled 'cell contents' at the top of the window will automatically have you ready to type.
		Then type anything you like into that cell. Once you have typed something
		into the cell, press the 'ENTER' key on your keyboard for it to be put into the cell
        If you want to change selections simply click on another cell on the spreadsheet
	What can I put in a cell?
		You can put anything, names, numbers, etc. but if you want a formula you must
        put an '=' as the first thing you type in. For example, =1 + 2 would show 3 after
        you put it in a cell.
        How do I open or save a file?
        To open a new file simply go to the button at the top left of the screen and go to
        File => New and this will create a new spreadsheet. To save a file simply go to File => Save or File => Save As
	What is the Rainbow Button?
		The rainbow button gives the UI a spicy new look that isn't distracting as it only colors the name region of the letters and numbers, it also plays cool music to!

Additional Features:
	-Rainbow Feature: makes grid rainbow and plays mario cart sound music
	-Save As: Allows the use of Save As like other programs
	-You can now save an empty spreadsheet for future use or whatever you need it for

Design Choices:
	-We decieded to make when cells are clikced the input box gets auto selected for ease of use. 
	-We also decieded to make cells values be displayed in the value box instantly on adding them to a file so that the user gets feedback instantly.
	-We added a Save As option so that it is more intutive on how to save like other softwares.

External Code Resources:
	-SpreadsheetPanel given by Professor Kopta
	-Researched how to do system audio and resource files on Stack Overflow

Incounterd Problems (now fixed):
	-Closing 1 spreadsheet closed all spreadsheets
	-Music continuted to play on a seprate thread after closing spreadsheet
	-Circular errors where allowed and not giving prompt like they should be
	-Spreadsheet would crash when becoming a certain sized
	-putting in invalid formulas would crash the program
	-Close file without being prompted to save which can lead to a loss of data
